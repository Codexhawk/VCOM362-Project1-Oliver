            <h2 class="subh">History of the Muffin<img src="Photos/muffin_stack.jpg" class="shift-right"></h2>
            <p class="box">The use of the term to describe what are essentially cupcakes or buns did not become common usage in Britain until the 
                last decades of the 20th century on the back of the spread of coffee shops such as Starbucks. Recipes for quickbread muffins are common in 
                19th-century American cookbooks. Recipes for yeast-based muffins, which were sometimes called "common muffins" or "wheat muffins" in 19th-century American cookbooks, 
                can be found in much older cookbooks.</p>
            <p class="box">In Fannie Farmer's Boston Cooking-School Cook Book, she gave recipes for both types of muffins, both those that used yeast to raise the dough and those that used a quick bread method, 
                using muffin rings to shape the English muffins. Farmer indicated that stove top "baking", 
                as is done with yeast dough, was a useful method when baking in an oven was not practical.</p>

            <h2 class="subh">Quick aside on English muffins<img src="Photos/english_muffin.jpg" class="shift-right"></h2>
            <p class="box">"English muffins" as American know them today are most closely connected with the ancient Welsh tradition of cooking small round yeast cakes known as "bara" [bread] "maen" [stone] on bakestones. "English muffins" were later cooked on griddles, as opposed to muffin tins.</p> 
            <p class="box">"The English muffin is round and made from a soft yeast-leavened dough enriched with milk and butter. It is usually cooked on a griddle, which gives it a flat, golden-brown top and bottom, and a white band around the waste and a light, spongy interior...This method appears as early as 1747 and was recommended by Hannah Glasse."</p>

        <div class="third">
            <h2 class="subh">Muffins vs. Cupcakes<img src="Photos/cupcake.jpg" class="shift-right"></h2>
            <p class="box">Muffins and cupcakes are easy things to confuse. They are both roughly the same shape and size in their typical form. The most obvious physical difference is that cupcakes often have frosting on them and muffins are unadorned, but that’s simply window dressing. You could put frosting on a steak but that wouldn’t make it a cupcake. (Note: do not put frosting on a steak.) 
            </p>
            <p class="box">The hint is in the names. A cupcake is assembled via any of the popular cake methods. A muffin is assembled via the muffin method. A cupcake is a cake the size of a cup. Hence the name. So it makes sense that it uses a cake method. Whereas a big muffin is generally considered a quickbread rather than a megamuffin or something equally silly.</p>
